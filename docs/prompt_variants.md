# AI Assistant Idea Generator - Prompt Variants

This document explains the different variants of the AI Assistant Idea Generator system prompt and when to use each one.

## Overview

The AI Assistant Idea Generator has been designed with multiple variants, each offering a unique approach to the ideation process. These variants allow you to tailor the ideation experience based on your specific needs, preferences, and the type of AI assistants you want to create.

## Available Variants

### 1. Original

The original system prompt focuses on randomized ideation with two primary workflows:
- **Full randomization**: Generating completely random AI assistant ideas
- **Topic-based randomization**: Generating ideas constrained to specific topics

**Best for**: Quick brainstorming sessions when you want a variety of ideas without a specific structure.

### 2. Domain Expert

This variant takes a domain-specific approach, focusing on creating AI assistants tailored to particular fields or industries.

**Best for**: 
- Industry-specific assistant ideation
- Creating specialized assistants that require domain expertise
- Exploring assistants that could replace or augment human expertise in specific fields

### 3. Problem Solver

This variant takes a methodical approach focused on identifying pain points first, then developing targeted AI solutions.

**Best for**:
- Addressing specific challenges or inefficiencies
- Creating assistants with measurable outcomes
- Practical solution development rather than exploratory ideation

### 4. Future Technology

This variant focuses on forward-looking AI assistants that anticipate emerging technologies and future trends.

**Best for**:
- Innovation planning
- Long-term product roadmapping
- Exploring cutting-edge applications of AI technology
- Understanding how AI assistants might evolve as technology advances

### 5. Collaborative Ideation

This variant emphasizes a collaborative process for developing AI assistant concepts through iterative refinement and co-creation.

**Best for**:
- In-depth development of a single assistant concept
- Refining rough ideas into well-defined assistants
- Interactive sessions where you want to actively participate in the ideation process
- Teams working together to develop assistant concepts

### 6. User Persona

This variant focuses on understanding the end-user's needs, behaviors, and contexts before generating assistant ideas.

**Best for**:
- User-centered design approaches
- Creating assistants for specific user types
- Ensuring assistants integrate well into users' existing workflows
- Considering the full user experience beyond just functionality

## Choosing the Right Variant

Consider these questions when selecting a variant:

1. **What's your primary goal?**
   - Quick ideas → Original
   - Industry-specific solutions → Domain Expert
   - Solving specific problems → Problem Solver
   - Forward-looking innovation → Future Technology
   - Developing a single concept in depth → Collaborative Ideation
   - User-centered design → User Persona

2. **How much time do you have?**
   - Quick session → Original or Problem Solver
   - In-depth exploration → Collaborative Ideation or Domain Expert

3. **What's your starting point?**
   - Specific domain → Domain Expert
   - Specific problems → Problem Solver
   - Specific users → User Persona
   - No specific constraints → Original or Future Technology

## Combining Variants

These variants can also be combined for more specialized ideation sessions. For example:
- Domain Expert + Future Technology for forward-looking industry-specific assistants
- Problem Solver + User Persona for user-centered solutions to specific challenges
- Collaborative Ideation + Domain Expert for in-depth development of specialized assistants
